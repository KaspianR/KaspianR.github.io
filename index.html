					<h1>More about me</h1>
					<p>
						My name is Kaspian Ringqvist and I live in southern Sweden. I have been programming for almost
						half my life and what started with making cool things in Unity just for the fun of it quickly
						turned into much more and now - a couple years later - it is what I'm hoping to do for a career.
						I'm comfortable with at least half a dozen programming languages and spend my days creating
						games at TGA or working on everything from websites to Discord bots with people from multiple
						different countries in my free time. Why don't you continue scrolling and have a look at what
						I've done during my time at TGA?
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<div>
						<h2>Tools</h2>
						<p>I enjoy tools development a lot and at TGA I've been involved with a number of tools ranging
							from level exporters for Unity to visual scripting solutions. My <a
								href="#fourth-section">specialization</a> even revolves around tools development.</p>
					</div>
					<div></div>
					<div>
						<h2>Gameplay</h2>
						<p>Gameplay is what I've worked with the most during my time at TGA and is also something I
							enjoy. During our game projects I've worked on everything from AI and interactables for
							mobile games to audio and collision systems.</p>

								<h2>G.O.S.T. <span>#5</span></h2>

									collect items and interact with objects to progress through a small lab.</p>
								<p>My contributions:</p>
								<ul>

								<h2>TÃ¥rta och Demoner <span>#4</span></h2>
								<p><b>Description:</b> This game was created in TGA's in-house engine and was a top-down
									adventure game with a heavy focus on combat. This was the first project I did some
									tools development for but I also helped out here and there with audio and other
									gameplay things.</p>
								<p>My contributions:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Created an editor extension that lets you start the game from Unity and handled
										exporting levels from Unity and importing them into the game</li>
									<li>Did some gameplay things such as destructable objects and audio implementation

								<h2>PitFoil <span>#3</span></h2>
								<p><b>Description:</b> This was the first game we made using TGA's own engine and was a
									2D platformer with a heavy focus on aesthetics and feel. I was more or less solely
									responsible for implementing audio using FMOD but also worked on some other gameplay
									aspects and with collisions.</p>

								<h2>Library of Illusions <span>#2</span></h2>
								<p><b>Description:</b> For this project, which was also done in Unity, we took
									inspiration from the puzzle game Monument Valley to create a game that was all about
									optical illusions and perspective. This time I almost exclusively worked on
									interactables and other moving parts in the game world.</p>
								<p>My contributions:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>All interactable things in the world and their foundation</li>
									<li>A number of other moving parts triggered by buttons and similar</li>

								<h2>Scatter <span>#1</span></h2>
								<p><b>Description:</b> This was our first project and supposed to be an endless
									runner-type game inspired by games such as Subway Surfers. It was created in Unity,
									featured 2 levels, and as we didn't have much time and were just getting started, I
									had no dedicated role in this project.</p>
