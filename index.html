					<h1>More about me</h1>
					<p>My name is Kaspian Ringqvist and I live in southern Sweden. I have been programming for almost
						half my life and what started with making cool things in Unity just for the fun of it quickly
						turned into much more and now - a couple of years later - it is what I'm hoping to do for a
						career. I'm comfortable with at least half a dozen programming languages and spend my days
						either playing games or creating them as well as working on everything from websites to Discord
						bots in my free time. Why don't you continue scrolling and have a look at what I've done during
						my time at TGA?</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<div>
						<h2>Tools</h2>
						<p>I enjoy tools development a lot and at TGA I've been involved with a number of tools ranging
							from level exporters for Unity to visual scripting solutions. My <a
								href="#specializationSection">specialization</a> even revolves around tools development.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div></div>
					<div>
						<h2>Gameplay</h2>
						<p>Gameplay is what I've worked with the most during my time at TGA and is also something I
							enjoy. During our game projects I've worked on everything from AI and interactables for
							mobile games to audio and collision systems.</p>

					<h1>Specialization</h1>
					<div></div>
				</div>
				<div id="specialization-div">
					<h2 id="specialization-background-header">Background</h2>
					<p id="specialization-background">For my specialization, I decided to delve deeper into tools
						creation by expanding on an idea I had during game project 4. This idea was a level exporter for
						Unity that wouldn't just export your level with a button but notice the user pressing play and
						doing so automatically in addition to generating and/or copying many other necessary
						files.<br><br>I knew I wanted to do something to do with tools as I hadn't gotten to do that
						very much before this point but this idea also felt both fun and challenging as it would expose
						me to several things I hadn't done before and left a lot of room for trying to improve
						convenience and ease of use which I enjoy trying to maximize.</p>
					<h2 id="specialization-description-header">The concrete idea</h2>
					<p id="specialization-description">I wanted to create a level exporter for Unity that focused
						heavily on convenience and ease of use and even simplified parts of our pipeline. I wanted to
						design it in such a way that it could work for nearly any project but decided to export the
						files in a way that would work for our custom engine as I was familiar with it and figured it
						would make it easy to test and structure the tool.</p>
					<h2 id="specialization-steps-header">A step-by-step guide covering what my exporter does</h2>
					<div id="specialization-steps">
						<div>
							<div></div>
							<div></div>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>Export level</h3>
						</div>
						<div>
							<div></div>
						</div>
						<div>
							<div>
								<ul>
									<li><b>I created my own way to save data to JSON.</b> There are a whole number of
										prebuilt ways to do this (including one that comes with Unity) but none really
										worked for my purposes and I also wanted more of a say in how objects are
										stored.
										<ul>
											<li><b>This makes it trivial to edit the format of basic objects.</b> Want
												vectors or colors as arrays instead of objects with properties? That's a
												30-second change. Want it to also include a property for its type so
												that we know that it's a 3D vector? No problem.</li>
											<li><b>My system also handles lists very well.</b> It works recursively so
												can serialize nested lists or objects.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li><b>I used reflection to get all fields and properties of any class and save
											it</b>, no matter if it comes built-in as part of Unity or is custom-made.
										Our engine is built on a component system so I wanted the exporter to easily
										support creating components in Unity that just store data and export that data
										to be used in the game.</li>
									<ul>
										<li><b>Say you want to create an enemy spawner for example.</b> Make a component
											in Unity that stores all the necessary data (what enemy to spawn, how often
											to spawn them, where to spawn them, etc.), and then all of that will be
											exported automatically without needing to touch the exporter. Level
											designers can then easily edit all that in the level editor and everything
											will work in game.</li>
									</ul>
									<li><b>I hard-coded some commonly used components.</b> This allowed me to add more
										advanced functionality for those or display them in a custom way for
										convenience.</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
							<div>
								<img src="/assets/json.png">
								<p>Example of a component exported using reflection - only the name and whether or not
									it was enabled was hard coded</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div>
							<div></div>
							<div></div>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>Prepare files</h3>
						</div>
						<div>
							<div></div>
						</div>
						<div>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<b>I copy the needed files from the asset folder in Unity to the game's asset
										folder.</b> This was used for meshes and textures since those are used in both
									places and the graphic artists appreciated only having to place their files in one
									folder as opposed to two.
									<ul>
										<li><b>I also use a command line utility to convert the PNGs to DDS files.</b>
											Our engine uses <code>.dds</code> but our artists create their textures in
											<code>.png</code> which is what Unity uses so not having to convert it every
											time saved them time. For bonus points, the command line utility used will
											be downloaded to the user's computer if they don't have it installed instead
											of having to do so manually or keeping it in the files you'd push to
											Perforce.
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li><b>I create JSON files for all materials.</b> Our engine uses JSON files for each
									material to keep track of all its textures, how metallic it is, etc., and creating
									that manually was a pain and caused a lot of texture. We did create a tool for it in
									our editor that we used for the game projects but I figured I'd add it to my tool as
									well.</li>
								<li><b>I keep track of the exported files in a JSON file.</b> This makes the process a
									lot faster and prevents unused files from staying in the game.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div>
							<div></div>
							<div></div>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>Start game</h3>
						</div>
						<div></div>
						<div>
							<ul>
								<li><b>I start the game automatically.</b> I start the game correctly right from the
									editor and even pass along what level we were just in so that that level can be
									started without having to go through the level selection.</li>
								<li><b>Optionally, the things logged to the game console can be sent to the Unity
										console.</b> In case of crashes and similar this is sometimes useful.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div id="final-notes-section">
						<div>
							<h2>How did it go?</h2>
							<p>Creating the tool went very well and didn't cause me any major issues. I initially tried
								to use Unity's built-in JSON utilities which didn't really work for what I wanted to do
								and my attempt to use a different one also didn't work because Unity blocks it (probably
								to encourage the usage of their one) so there I lost some time but that was probably the
								biggest issue I encountered and didn't bother me as it gave me a chance to build my own
								which was a good learning opportunity.<br><br>The only other thing I can really think of
								that became a problem is that the tool can be a bit slow sometimes, especially when
								converting textures to DDS, so if I was to continue working on it I would definitely try
								to improve that either by looking at more efficient ways to use the converter or only
								export it when something has changed.</p>
